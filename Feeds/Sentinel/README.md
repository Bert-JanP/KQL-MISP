# Sentinel

At this moment the Sentinel queries have not been implemented yet. If you want to use queries in Sentinel use the [Defender For Endpoit](../Defender%20For%20Endpoint/) queries and change the Timestamp to TimeGenerated to continue. 

For better results also add a union to include CEF and Syslog events. This will be implemented in later phases as well.
